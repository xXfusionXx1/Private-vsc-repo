        <h3 style="color: black;">Music production <br> & Video games</h3>
        <p>I enjoy in my free time making music beats as i have a strong passion for music, 
        if im not making music in my spare time I am instead playing video games such as Dark souls games and Call of duty as i enjoy fast action games that are skill demanding.<hr>
        Call of Duty: <br>
        The game franchise is one of the most iconic and influential video game series in history, known for its fast-paced, cinematic first-person shooter gameplay. <br>
        Since its debut in 2003, the franchise has evolved from depicting the gritty realism of World War II battles to more futuristic and modern warfare settings, including speculative global conflicts and space-based combat.<br>
        At its core, Call of Duty thrives on providing immersive, large-scale war experiences, combining intense single-player campaigns with robust, multiplayer modes.<br>
        The series is often praised for its tight gunplay mechanics, strategic elements, and stunning graphics, which continue to push the boundaries of realism and technology in gaming.<br>
        With subseries like Modern Warfare and Black Ops, Call of Duty has managed to stay relevant by constantly reinventing itself, blending storytelling with adrenaline-filled action. The Modern Warfare subseries redefined the military shooter genre by introducing morally complex narratives, advanced tactical warfare, and photorealistic environments. Meanwhile, the Black Ops games introduced conspiracy theories, mind-bending plot twists, and a fan-favorite Zombies mode, where players fend off hordes of the undead in increasingly bizarre and creative scenarios.<hr>
        Souls games: <br>
        The Souls games, created by FromSoftware and led by visionary director Hidetaka Miyazaki, have become legendary in the gaming world for their challenging combat, deep lore, and hauntingly atmospheric worlds.<br>
        Beginning with Demon’s Souls (2009) and reaching wider fame with the Dark Souls trilogy, these games have forged a new genre often referred to as “Souls-like,” defined by their punishing difficulty, intricate level design, and a unique approach to storytelling that leaves much for the player to discover on their own.<br>
        At the heart of the Souls franchise is its combat system, which emphasizes patience, precision, and mastery. Players face a relentless array of grotesque enemies and massive bosses, where every swing of the sword, dodge roll, and block can mean the difference between life and death. Death itself, however, is not the end but a learning tool; players are encouraged to adapt, evolve, and persevere through repeated failures. This brutal, but fair challenge creates an immense sense of satisfaction upon victory.<br>
        The Souls games have earned a reputation not only for their difficulty but for their innovative approach to game design, influencing countless titles in the process. They stand as modern masterpieces in gaming, offering experiences that challenge both the player’s skill and their perception of storytelling in games.<hr>
        Music production: <br>
        I use a specific software called FL Studio to create my beats, I have been using this software for a while now and is a powerful and versatile digital audio workstation (DAW) used by musicians, producers, and DJs to create, mix, and edit music.<br>
        Renowned for its user-friendly interface and loop-based production approach, FL Studio offers a comprehensive suite of features, including multi-track recording, MIDI support, real-time audio stretching, and an extensive library of virtual instruments and effects.<br>
        Its intuitive piano roll and pattern-based workflow make it especially popular for genres like electronic music and hip-hop. Constantly evolving with free lifetime updates, FL Studio has become a staple for both beginners and professional producers worldwide.<br>
        I use this digital audio workstation alongside digital keyboards and a next generation music production system called the maschine mk3, which is a powerful and versatile instrument that combines the functionality of a drum machine.
